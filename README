The PIAPI is a collection of services that allow remote gathering
of Penguin PowerInsight samples through the use of a one-to-one pairing
between a proxy running on the host and an agent running on the
embedded PowerInsight device.

To build on the embedded device you will need to have a PowerInsight
device with root access or cross-compilers on the host system.
The pidev.h / libpidev.so files and native compilers are provided by
Penguin Computing.
