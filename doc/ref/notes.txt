isci2003

- processor power measurement and estimation methodology
- prior work used performance counters to estimate energy
- this work on counter-based power estimation on aggressively-clock-gated super-scalar processors
- gather live based on performance counters
- analysis using bayesian similarity matrices (probablistic)
- total-power using sampled multimeter data (correllated with perf counters)
- clamp multimeter on appropriate power lines
- simulation not good for thermal research
- large thermal constants mandate long simulation runs


feng2005

- framework for direct automatic profiling of power consumption for non-interactive, parallel scientific applications on high-performance distributed systems
- study of NAS parallel benchmarks on a 32-node beowulf cluster
- study of power-performance efficiency "operating point"
- 10 multi-meters per node connected through shunt resistor through ATX extension cables
- non-concurrent collection (fix on one node, then rerun on another node fixed) that is time consuming and manual
- 4 samples per second communicate through RS232 connections
- derived and deduced power measurements for each component (CPU, memory, NIC, disk)
- memory system power is extrapolated through experiments with 1, 2, 3, 4 memory modules
- CPU is the only true measurement since it is isolated
- compared with intel and ibm specs
- requires source code modification (instrumenting)
- the average power consumption goes down as the number of nodes increase
- three strategies for scheduling: performance, energy, energy-performance
- scheduler could use EDP (energy-delay product) or ED2P as in mobile computing
- does not address how to provide the scheduler with application-specific information
- cites work for single system mostly
- first to aim towards developing power profiling tools for parallel apps and distributed systems at component level
- limited scalability and sampling frequency


laros2009

- implementation of a scalable power measurement framework
- implemented power conserving measures on LWK (Catamount)
- scalable mechanism for fine-grained high frequency power measurements
- Cray motherboard provide interfaces that can be exploited to measure power usage
- tiered network using onboard embedded processor and in cabinet processor
- per socket collection at 100 Hz with +/-2 amperes accuracy
- beat CNL on power management during idle current draw
- also save on heat reduction power usage since less heat is being generated on idle nodes
- LWK will halt slave cores when idle and awaken when signaled by master core
- monitored application power signatures (characteristic signatures)
- increased power efficiency while reducing runtime
- first quantitative study of OS noise using kernel-level noise injection framework in LWK
- work shows possible to collect scalable, granular, high-frequency power on HPC platforms (bb makes it practical)
- cites related work for resource scheduling based on energy has been done for real-time and embedded systems
 
bedard2011

- low-cost power monitoring devices that operate inside commodity computer systems
- inserted between a system's power supply and motherboard
- on six DC rails and reporting measurments at 50 Hz / 3 KHz over USB
- fits in a standard 3.5" hard drive bay
- using AC monitors like PowerEgg and WattsUp inadequate
- fast variations in the DC load often do not translate to corresponding variations on the AC side of the supply
- others don't scale to large clusters due to high equipment cost
- powermon isolates measurements between a machine's subsystems
- standard ATX pin interface
- can be used in a "self-monitoring" configuration
- clock synchonization can be managed across systems
- reduced overhead on host system (bb solution has no overhead)
- 12-bit sampling resolution (bb cape has 10-bit)
- uses a 5-milliohm sense resistor (bb cape cables are passive)
- can accomodate currents up to 10 amperes on each trace (bb cape is higher)
- powermon temperature rise of 4C, powermon2 rise of 20C with 10 amp load (a lot of heat)
- configurable sample rate and sensor state (like bb)
- output 32-bit words with sensor data and timestamp (like bb)
- total cost less than $150 each when fabricated in quantities of 5 or more
