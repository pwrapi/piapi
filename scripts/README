Simple scripts to make some common tasks easier for launching
and for post processing data.

______________________________________________________________________
check_clients_on - simply ssh'es to each beagle and doesa ps to 
see if there are any clients already running on the beagle. Should
see 0's if not and > 0 if there is
RUN AS ROOT

Usage:
check_clients_on 1 100

Note: the names for the beagles are teller-pm00, teller-pm01 etc
specify them numerically. Do not specify the leading 0 for beagles
< 10

______________________________________________________________________
start_clients_on - uses client_start script which must be located
in the root home directory of each node to start a client. 
Note: client_start uses 10.54.0.1 as the server which is the admin
node. 
RUN AS ROOT

Usage:
start_clients_on 1 100
or
start_clients_on 1 100 1

Note: must privide the clients to act upon, optional interval may 
be specified after. Interval is how many times per second.

______________________________________________________________________
control_clients_on - uses the control.pl command to control the list
of clients specified, in the same way of course. Just makes it easier
to control larger numbers of clients
RUN AS ROOT

Usage:
control_clients_on 1 100 start|stop
or
control_clients_on 1 100 start|stop 1

Note: you must provide the clients to act on and start or stop.
The port number or 8 for all ports is optional. Defalt = 8 or all ports.

______________________________________________________________________
kill_clients_on - uses client_kill locally on node so depends upon it being
in the root home directory. Basically does a killall of the client
processes. Easy way to clean up the client processes on a range of nodes.
RUN AS ROOT

Usage:
kill_clients_on 1 100
